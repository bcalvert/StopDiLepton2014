# Stop Dilepton Analysis

This repository contains the bulk (soon to be all) of my code (scripting languages, C++, python, etc.) related to my PhD Thesis.

I am currently updating this (notably, adding in a proper makefile system, further splitting the code into proper, separate modules, etc.) as part of a side project with the CMS research group at UMD.
