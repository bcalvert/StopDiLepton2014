Update of things so that Ted can edit scripts in his own local area to facilitate limits/optimal cut maps

====StopFillFunctions.h====
Added in function, CharginoMassFrac,  to calculate the chargino mass fraction, "x", given input chargino, chi0, and Stop masses.
Added in function, PassesFullSelection, that returns a boolean if a given event passes the full selection as we've defined it
Added in function, PrintEvent, that prints out relevant qualities/quantities for the current event when called
Moved the "inELI->GrabbedFromTree()" call out of SetEventInformation function into the body of the plot filler macro
Added in the SmearMETPhi, SmearMETX, and SmearMETY to the string:float map
====StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h====
Added a number of histograms that were originally not added to the smearing vector (MT2lb, MET_div_Meff, etc.)
Added a 2D histogram Smeared MT2ll_vs_MT2lblb

====StopPlotSetup.h====
Added a set of functions, BadBinCheck, binFinder, PassFailCuts, and PassCutHisto that together work to allow for the creation of arbitrary MT2ll/MT2lblb cuts for a Pass/Fail histogram
As part of this, have to work some magic so as not to scale things that have already been scaled (so I added in a "doScale" option)

Altered the function, SignalSkimEfficiencyCalc, to utilize the "Histos" files that Javier provided me that contain number of points run per mass point

Added in an ability to look in a custom path for the data files (this allows one to run the local copies of scripts from their local github directory and read in data from my area, for example)

Added some terms, currently turned off, to the two-dimensional FOM histogram function -- a verbosity term and a "penalty" term, which is a uniform systematic that increases the denominator.

Added in ability for handling T2bw cases

====NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C====
Added in things to be able to properly handle signal files (relatively different binning for different samples, T2bw and Chargino Mass fractions, etc.)

Added in the plotting of the 2D smeared histograms
Moved the calls for "GrabbedFromTree()" to here from StopPlotSetup.h
====NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C====
Added in the T2bw stuff, i.e. Chargino Mass Frac stuff, as well as proper binning checks for the signal samples in general
Added in bug check to check for "weird" points in the skims

====MT2CutYieldCalc.C====
Added in ability to calculate custom "Pass/Fail Cut" histograms (see StopPlotSetup.h)
Added in maximization of FOM histogram checks to calculate optimal MT2ll/MT2lblb cut values
Added in the custom path stuff described above

====StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C====
Added in custom path stuff
