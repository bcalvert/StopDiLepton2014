========10/15/13========
Big Structure update to the code, plus some physics as well
--Added in structure called ElectronEventPointers plus analogous ones for Muons, PFJets, and GenJets
-These structures are true C++ style structures in that they are just repositories to agglomerate all the various "vectors" containing event information for the objects (kinematics, quality cut variables) in an easily handled structure to tidy up the code
--Added in structures for PFJets to basically make it easier to pass around the 4-vectors and associated jet information (b-tag discriminant value, parton flavor). This also facilitates sorting the Jets by pT after smearing, for example (i.e. sorting the PFJet structure so as to maintain the associated non-kinematic variables with the correct jets)
SImilar thing was added for GenJets and Leptons (note, the need to sort Leptons and keep associated information came up in the code where I select the dilepton pair -- this was a hindrance to syncrhonization with Oviedo in the EMu channel)
--BTagging Scale factors were added in (using BTagSFUtil.C and BTagSFUtil.h -- both should be located in HeaderFiles along with their associated additional files) -- See the Skimming code to see how they play out
--Worked on implementing Jet Energy Smearing for the purposes of MET agreement - this is still a work in progress but I've more or less developed the smearing code

Added a lot of "verbosity triggered" debug statements to facilitate synchronization with Oviedo, these are controlled by the "levelVerbosity" variable

Consequently, a lot of the changes in this revision are updates to the code to utilize the new structures, implement in BTag ScaleFactors, correctly handle the Smeared Jet collections, etc.

Nevertheless, will list some specific changes down below
====HistogramSystematics2.h====
Added in some "verbosity level" triggered debug statements (commenting out the debug statements)
====StopFillFunctions.h====
Updated MET Phi Corrections (including a trigger for ReReco)
Added METSystShift function to this file
Removed "EventType" function (spurious -- not needed because other functions handle it)
Updated MC scale factors
====StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h====
Fixed an absolute value of SCEta (was missing one -- line below)
-    if (SCEta >= SCEtaMax || ((SCEta >= SCEtaBarrelCut ) && (SCEta <= SCEtaEndcapCut))) {
+    if (fabs(SCEta) >= SCEtaMax || ((fabs(SCEta) >= SCEtaBarrelCut ) && (fabs(SCEta) <= SCEtaEndcapCut))) {
fixed the same situation with the deltaPhiIn, DeltaEtaIn and other electron quality cuts

The functions JetResolutionHighPt, SmearJet, ResolutionHistMaker, VecJetHighPtResolutionTF1, and JetSmear are all related to the Jet Energy Smearing -- they should be fairly self-explanatory if not well commented

Added in the systematics histogram booking for the BTag scale factors -- still working on this a bit (part of why I developed these structures)

Changed MT2lblb blinding to 170 GeV (to make a cleaner cut -- old value was 172)

Added in ReReco data as an option (including properly showing its name in output files)

Added in ability to calculate METPhi corrections, for example the function VectorDist is needed for this, along with HistogramAdderDataTwoDee

Added in some functions to facilitate making one and two-dimensional figure of merit plots
Fixed a lot of minor things that were hindering stuff (like saving as .C, I had plots with histograms with spaces in the name which screws up ROOT)

Made function for the 1D F.O.M. plot "FOMHist"

====NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C====
Added in specific PU reweighting for signal (still have to add in specific scale factors
Recalculated Oviedo PURW
Associated stuff for BTag SF Systematic, want to fix this somewhat, however
====NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C====
Made some files for the Jet Energy Smearing that I grab in here
Most of the structure changes talked about at the very beginning are found in this file
Added in ability to run on a specific run:event combo

The btagging scale factor and associated systematic has different implementation/values for signal, as can be seen in its implementation here

====StopDict.cpp====
Added in StopStructDefinitions.h into the dictionary so it gets compiled properly
====MT2CutYieldCalc.C====
Associated stuff for making TwoDee and OneDee F.O.M. hists
Associated stuff for allowing this code to calculate Data Driven TTBar normalization scale factor
Updated said scale factor

====StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C====
Added in ability to turn off the legend when plotting (for cases where it will overlap with the histograms)
Added in ability to try and add multiple samples in together to make a composite "sample" to plot -- central value works right now but still debugging the systematics (command line option is "multiChan" followed by the multiChanSetupFileName) I've included an example file for it, but still need to write the readMe for it
====plotHaddersStop.C====
Added in ReReco hadding (i.e. luminosity scaling)


====ADDITIONAL MACROS/FILES====
Added in the macro for making the Signal PU -> SM PU reweighting distribution, "PURWHistMaker.C"
Added in the JetResolution (low pT jets) text file
Added in the example "Multi channel plot add" file "testInclusive.txt"
Added in the macro to calculate METPhi corrections, "METPhiCorrCalculator.C"
Added all the associated BTagSF files
Added in the Data/MC Jet Resolution smear factor file, "pfJetResolutionMCtoDataCorrLUT.root"
========9/25/13========
Worked on synchronizing with Oviedo code results
====StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h====
Fixed minor bug where ECALBarrelEta end was listed as 1.442 instead of 1.442

Changed around Electron selection
Added in cutting on requiring PFElectronPt and ElectronPt within 10 GeV
Added in cuts on Electron DeltaPhiIn, DeltaEtaIn, SigIetaIeta, HtoE ratio
Changed cut on electron object eta to be cutting on electron supercluster eta
Above cuts depend upon electron being either "isEE" or "isEB"
Added in cuts for electron impact parameter (w.r.t. PV) and deltaZ (w.r.t. PV)
Added in cuts for electron "no. of missing hits" and electron's abs(1/E -1/p)

Changed around Muon selection
Added in cutting on requiring PFMuonPt and MuonPt within 5 GeV
Fixed bug in Muon DZ cut, which was always checking against leading vertex -- now I have to find the leading "good" vertex in a function called goodVertexSelection
Added in cuts on ("isGlobalMuon" or "isTrackArbitratedMuon")
Added in cuts on Muon number of matching stations, number of valid pixel hits in the tracker, number of layers in the muon system
Changed isolation variables to use the 0.3 cone variety

Changed Jet stuff
DeltaR cone for cutting leptons upgraded to 0.4 from 0.5
Fixed a minor bug with getting Jet B-tags -- I create a vector of good jets and then iterate through to check whether the given jet passes our b-tag, but the issue was that I was bringing in the vector of b-tags for EVERY jet, not the jets that passed quality cuts
Have almost finished putting in a "fix" for JES systematics, wherein I save the list of good jets passing our basic Jet ID cuts. Later I cut on pT for this collection to select our jets but for MET JES purposes I keep all jets with pT > 9 GeV. Initially I was cutting on |eta| < 2.4 (matching our jet selection) but I've put the cut later on and just need to check that it's not too extreme a difference (i.e. that it makes sense)

Added in blinding for an EMu channel that was missing it (DiLepInZMass2Jets1BJetMET>=40)
Fixed bug in the sorting of backgrounds

Added in functions for making the 2D Figure of Merit (S/sqrt(S+B)) plots, stuff like SystHistFinderTwoDee and HistogramAdderMC (overloaded for TH2Fs)
and, perhpas most import, the function FOMHist

Added in UncEnSC systematics for the "error" graphs

====NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C====
Fixed ECALBarrel Eta End bug (1.442 vs. 1.4442)
====NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C====
Added in necessary branches/variables for all the additional ish to cut on (described above)
Fixed MassPoint rounding number (25 instead of 10) for T2bw signal files

====MT2CutYieldCalc.C====
Started adding in ability to calculate TTBar normalization with this code (not finished yet, I believe)
Added in F.O.M. plot making to this macro
Added in two different ways of getting the yield, the basic yields for various channels (doYieldV2) and the full selection yields with systematics (doYieldV1); by default doYieldV1 is turned ON
Added in different version numbers ability
