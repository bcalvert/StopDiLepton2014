========3/3/14========
MAJOR UPDATE/REWRITE of many aspects of the code

The overarching theme of this update has been to improve the robustness/quality of the code,
The execution has by-and-large consisted of utilizing defined structs to facilitate centralization and modularity of different processes

For the most part documentation of what individual functions/structures/classes are doing will be contained within or near the definitions of said functions/structures/classes


I should first note that I have shifted around directory structures a little bit to facilitate organization of the github repository
This includes making sub-directories within the HeaderFiles directory for example

Added Directory 
RandomImages -- contains random .pdf files I found in my clean-up/organization that looked at least marginally important

NonDataRootFiles -- contains either .root files or subdirectories containing .root files that are relevant for various parts of the analysis, but not actually "data" files; for example, lepton scale factors and smearing templates

-- HeaderFiles/StopTreeManipulations/ -- 
contains header files related to TTree manipulations
-- HeaderFiles/BTagSFFiles/ -- 
contains all the various .C and .h files for BTagging SF central value and systematic variations in MC

That said, here is a list of new/changed macro/header files

==New Macro Files==
PlotShowingCode/StopPlot_DYWeightCalculator.C
PlotShowingCode/StopPlot_TTBarWeightCalculator.C
-- Both of the above are used to automatically generate root files contain scale factors for ttbar and DY 
-- nominally I'm going to combine them into one (if and when I get time)

==Changed Macro Files==
NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C
-- Reworked the skimmer to run on the new Legacy nTuples
-- It still runs on old nTuples, just inefficiently
-- Reworked the skimmer to utilize the restructuring in header files (non-trivial change)
-- Split the B-tagging SF systematic into tagging efficiency and mistag rate
-- Changed the by-hand MET smearing so that it works by looking at number of jets in the event and utilizes an appropriate smearing template based on this
-- removed the DESY nTuple stuff (useless at this point more or less)

NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
-- Reworked the plot maker to run on the new Legacy nTuples
-- Better structured the code to utilize the restructuring in header files (non-trivial change)
-- Essentially, all changes in the Skimmer had analogous changes here
-- Added in options to turn off genRecoilRW for non Top samples
-- Added in options to only run on a certain dilepton type


MT2CutYieldCalc.C
StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C

Modified both to work the upgraded data structures and restructured header files
-- The changes aren't fully done
-- Basic functions that we have been utilizing, so 1D plotting, basic yield calculations, ore what has been saved/recovered for now

Script that auto-generates the necessary branch addresses and subsequent names to read in for the input variables when running over the Maryland SkimTrees to make plots, it reads the file StopOutTreeManipulations.h and saves to the file StopInTreeManipulations_PlotMaker.h
Changed Shell scripts
