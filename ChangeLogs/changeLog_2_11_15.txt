Added a bunch of macros used for Signal Efficiency map making
1) MakeLeptFiltSF.C -- Calculates the gen-level lepton filter efficiency per mass point (it's roughly 55%, but it does depend upon SUSY masses)
2) MakeCoarseEffMap.C -- Calculate the signal efficiency in the SUSY mass plane for passing a given set of MT2 cuts (whether 1D, 2D, or 3D)
3) MakeSmoothedEffMap.C -- Take the coarse efficiency maps from 2) and smooth them out to ameliorate the point-to-point statistical fluctations in the signal MC
4) MakeSignalYield.C -- Take the smoothed efficiency maps from 3) and turn them into # of signal events passing a given set of MT2 cuts
5) DrawSignalStuff.C -- Draw the maps made in any of 1), 2), 3), or 4), also has an option to take the results of 4) and spit them out into text form
6) MakeSignalYieldText.C -- Calls the DrawSignalStuff.C macro with the signal yield text option and saves it to a file (for use in C&C analysis)
7) MakeSignalYieldMT2_IndivPoint.C -- Takes the signal yield maps from 4) and turns them into actual 1D, 2D, or 3D MT2 histograms


Also added in a control script
makeSignalEffMaps.sh

That enables one to do 1), 2), 3), 4), or 6) in a reasonable fashion
