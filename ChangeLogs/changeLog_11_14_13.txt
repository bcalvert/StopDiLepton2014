========11/14/13========
Primary update was a final push of stuff needed for unblinding

Current To-Do Items:
SmearMETPhi histogram isn't booking properly
Smearing based on METX and METY isn't working properly
FOM stat errors are wrong right now -- also need to fold in systematic errors

====HistogramSystematics2.h====
Changed relative errors here when calculating the ratio graphs (had them flipped)
====StopFillFunctions.h====
MC Lepton Scale Factors are no longer contained here (instead stored elsewhere)

Wrote a function METComponents that breaks down MET and MET Phi into MET X and MET Y (or vice versa)

Added in Smeared MET X, MET Y, and MET Phi to the Map

====StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h====

Added in Smeared MET X, MET Y, and MET Phi to the histograms for the smeared case

Although not getting used, added in the function jetPassPFID to this file (use a different function for checking that)
 Instead, I utilize the function PassesID (a function of PFJet) for checking if a Jet passes ID requirements

Made special OneDee Hist Vec for the unblinding OneDeeHistTVecSpecial

Changed around SmearHist() to account for additional MET smearing template files I got from Matthieu
Subsequently changed around SetMETSmearHistVec()

Started to add in the smearing based on METX and METY but was running into issues with those prescriptions (smearing was giving ridiculous METPhi values) so this still needs work
====StopPlotSetup.h====
Added in bits for handling looking at unblinded data

Added in function IndividualHistSysts that grabs systematics for individual MC contributing topologies (TTBar, VV, etc.)
As a corollary to this, added in function SystGraphMakersIndivSamp to make the syst graphs for individual MC topologies

Added in effective error graph smoothing function, SmoothedTGraph, that utilizes two additional written in functions,
SetPointsAsymmGraphfromHists
and 
SetPointsHistsfromAsymmGraph

Altered FOMHist function to have additional systematics (BTagging) and have print values allowed (also turned of FOM stat error for now)

====StopStructDefinitions.h====
Added in some functions to HistogramT to help with booking of associated histograms
Added struct JetCutInfo that contains the settings for what Jet ID to apply
Added in some additional functions to PFJet to help with auto-setting variables
Added in functions into the DiLepInfo Struct to help with calculating event scale factors
Similar thing with EventMETInfo (functions to faciliate utilizing the struct)

====NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C====
Added in the scale factor histograms
====NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C====
Added in new MET smearing template files
Added in foundations for new MET XY smearing
====MT2CutYieldCalc.C====
Added in stuff for new FOM hists
Added in unblinding
Added in other minor options
Updated the TTBar normalization scale factor
Added in ability to see individual MC source systematics

====StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C====
Added in Unblinding option
Added in Smooth Systematics error band option
Updated the TTBar normalization scale factor
