Added in RootFileGeneratingMacros and two associated macros

1) RootFileGeneratingMacros/RootHistoGenerator.C

-- Used for generating Lepton Fake/Prompt rates (and nominally, also the Jet Resolution histogram but this feature isn't ready yet)

2) RootFileGeneratingMacros/RootHistoGenerator_StopXSec.C

-- Used for taking the 5 GeV spaced 8 TeV stop xsections and turning them into interpolated cross sections for 0.5 GeV steps (for example for samples spaced in 12.5 GeV steps)

In general, added in functions as part of the Stop XSection interpolation

1) Added in function LogLogGraph that makes a TGraph which is Log-Log scale from an input TH1F

2) Added in function ResidualsGraph that takes an input TGraph and input TF1 and calculates the residuals

3) Added in function UnLogHist that takes an input TF1 and input TH1F that one wants to set bin contents for and expands out the TF1 values into the TH1F

4) Added in function UnLogXAxis that takes an input TGraph and sets its xaxis to be not log scale

HeaderFiles/StopPlottingHeaderFiles.h
######################################

1) Added in some include statements so that the plot showing code can work with the custom hashing definitions

HeaderFiles/StopRootHistoGenFunctions.h

1) Changed the 2D CombineHists to take in a "addString" to append upon the output hist name

2) Added in a 1D version of the CombineHists function (note, I should be able to combine these dudes)

3) Added in the function CloneVals that allows one to copy values over from one histogram into another assuming same salient values for x-axis (number of bins and relevant physical range one is trying to cover)

4) Added in the structure StopXSecFitter that is used as part of the xsection interpolation

######################################
HeaderFiles/Typedefs.h
######################################

1) Added in some forward declarations of custom structures so that maps can be defined

######################################
PlotMakingCode/NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
######################################

1) Changed around how the Stop Mass to set xsection is done (probably need to debug)

######################################
PlotShowingCode/MT2CutYieldCalc.C
######################################
1) Added in print statement when cutting by hand (for limit setting purposes)

2) Added in bool doVerb checks for whether or not to do verbosity statements
