One general change with this update is to move from using ordered maps in the plot filling code to using unordered maps

This led to a speed up of about a factor of 2 --

This shows up in multiple files (map -> unordered_map)
Fortunately, the functions used by map and unordered_map are effectively the same so it is super easy to switch one for the other

This included the addition of custom hash functions (which the unordered map required) which are contained in HeaderFiles/Hasher.h and HeaderFiles/HasherPart2.h

As well, I moved a number of typedefs of "maps" into the header files HeaderFiles/Typedefs.h and HeaderFiles/TypedefsPart2.h

1) Added in additional safety factors into the Electron etas used for SF/Fake rate calculations to ensure that bad binning doesn't happen
