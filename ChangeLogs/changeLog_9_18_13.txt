HeaderFiles/StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h
Moved a number of functions into a different file, StopFillFunctions.h, in the same directory
Added a function, OneDProjectionReturnVec, related to the purposes of calculating OneD pdfs (by projecting from input 2D histograms) for the MT2 Unclustered energy systematics
Added a function, DeltaMT2UncEn, which given an input vector of TH1Fs (i.e. input PDFs), an input 2D histogram (to find which TH1F to grab), and an input MT2 value, calculates the DeltaMT2 coming from unclustered energy systematics

Added in a function, ElectronEffectiveArea, for calculating effective area of electrons (related to picking isolated electrons)
Updated the electron picking functions to be in line with Oviedo's strategy (and the correct one from EGamma POG perspective)
Modified the Electron and Muon picking functions to allow for calculating systematic shifted (lepton ES systematic) versions of the muons/electrons

Added in a function, IsoLeptonsPickDESY, to pick the IsoLeptons for Skimming DESY
(including lepton energy scale systematics)

Added in a function, LeptonPair, that takes in the vector of input "isolated" leptons and finds the pair satisfying event selection requirements (if any exist)

Added in a function, JESUncertFactor, that calculates the JES systematic uncertainty given an input 2D histogram of uncertainties, what shift direction (and magnitude!) and the input jet Pt and jet Eta

Added in a function, JetInfoDESY, that finds the number of jets passing selection requirements (including being separate from the isolated leptons in the event), and allows for JES systematics calculations. This function does NOT do the Pt cut; that has been relegated to a different function, JetPtCut

Added in MT2 Unclustered Energy systematics and Jet Energy systematics to the relevant spots
Re-added back in systematics for 2D histograms (made it general, but in the end it only applies additionally for 2D histograms now)

Changed binning for energy/pT plots to be every 10 GeV (to better show cuts)
Added three 1D hists, relative lepton PF isolation (for lead and sub-lead lep) and the "channel cut flow"

Removed some unnecessary 2D histograms and added in MT2ll vs. MT2lb histogram

Properly blinded the emu in Z mass region w/ jet cuts

Added a MT2ll > 80 blinded sub-channel

Added events in the Z mass, with either exactly 0 or 1 jets (two separate channels)
==
StopPlotHaddInfo.h
Changed how the Oviedo normalization numbers are accessed

fixed some minor bugs, notable one being with ttbar exclusive sample cross sections
Added in some additional samples (in appropriate spots) that were available from Oviedo
==
StopPlotSetup.h
Fixed some minor bugs
Fixed inputfile grabbing to work with DESY skimmed outputs
Added in JetEnergy Scale systematics (need to add in unclustered energy systematics still)
Added in "Other nTuple ratio plots", an option to show whichever nTuple wasn't grabbed (of the di-set of Oviedo/DESY) and display it on the same ratio plot (as a different color) for comparison purposes
Added in "Smart Ratio Axes", an option that "smartly" sets the ratio axes to facilitate full visibility of the Data/MC ratios
==
NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
Moved MetPhiCorrect function to the function header files
Added in unclustered energy and Jet energy systematics (Jet energy to everything where it's relevant, unclustered just to MT2 variables)
Added in option for changing the sub-lepton pT cut
Re-added in systematics for 2D plots
Added in proper effects of energy scale systematics on event selection (i.e. lepton ES on dilepton selection as an example) -- NOTE this was a NON-TRIVIAL CHANGE. MANY LINES changed as a result!
Added in trigger stuff
Removed DESY plot making from this script (DESY now gets skimmed like Oviedo)
Moved getMT2 function out of this file into a header file
==
NewOviStopPlotSkimmer.C
Added in JES systematics, including grabbing JES systematics 2D hists
Accounted for the effects of JES and LepES systematics on event selections (affecting what gets saved)
Included trigger information
Updated electron and muon selections (especially electrons) for Oviedo Skimming
ADDED DESY to the skimmer -- lots of lines of code
Added option for picking out a specific run and printing information from that run
==
StopDict.h (in both PlotMaking and PlotSkimming areas)
Updated to include the additional relevant file, StopFillFunctions.h"
==
StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C
Lots of minor changes related to what's been discussed for above listed changes in other files
Some cleaning of the code

HeaderFiles/HistogramSystematics2.h
-Removed some extraneous debug statements
-Slightly changed how graph names are saved (to make debugging easier)
-Changed the algorithm for what happens if the script cannot find any histogram with the systematic name in question (for example genStop Xsec in non-signal files)
^technically, I've also changed how the histograms are grabbed to make sure to grab central value histograms whenever possible if the given systematic isn't available (so that net error for said systematic for said histogram ends up being 0)

HeaderFiles/StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h
-Added in additional Scale Factor for the three di-lep channels, constructed in such a way to bring the TTBar data-driven scaling factor (i.e. normalization factor in MT2 control region) into agreement for all three dilep channels
-Added in some additional histograms:
--)MT2ll for different delta phi regions between the leptons
--)MT2lb for different delta phi regions between the "b-lep" vecs (i.e. the 'b-jet' lepton pairings that are used to calculate the MT2lb)
--)MT2lb for different delta phi regions between the two leading jets (need to check this to make sure I use the "correct" jets)
--)MET/M_effective, MET/(S_T + MET), including for different "passes MT2ll Cut"
-Removed H_MT2lb_vs_DeltaPhiLepB0LepB1 for space purposes
-Removed SampleT events_NBJetsGeq1 for space purposes

HeaderFiles/StopPlotSetup.h
-Added in sorting of histograms (for the purposes of the legend/log scale sensibilities) -- right now sorting on a predetermined order but ostensibly could add in sorting by the "integral" of the histograms in question
-Fixed handling of "exclusive samples" for TTbar in Oviedo for madgraph (need to confirm this works 100% of the time though)
-Added in ability to load in NonFineBin signals for plotting purposes (still needs some work though)
-Added in function HistogramUnderflowOverflow, which basically sets up under/over flow bins if the associated booleans are true
-Changed how histograms are picked out of the file; since TH(1/2/3)(F/D) all inherit from TH1 class, I grab TH1 and then project/cast into appropriate histogram depending upon the circumstances (haven't yet implemented this for the 2D and 3D case, but it works for the 1D case, both for central values and for systmatics)
-Made a function, SystGraphMakers, which creates the associated systematic error "graphs" for the various things (SM bkgd, Signal); this is a carbon copy of the associated code that was in the plot showing macro, just put here to save space
-Changed color of systematics bands in ratio plots to be kYellow
-Added in legend for systematics band in ratio plots

PlotMakingCode/NewOviStopPlotFillerRunOnSkim_wSyst.C
-Removed 2D and 3D systematics for now (space purposes)
-Added in necessary calculations/variables for the histograms I added in the StopFunctionDefinitions_v2.h
-Fixed weights for the Stop signal (for example LepEFSF systematics)

PlotShowingCode/StopPlotsSpectraShowNewDESY_wSyst.C
Associated changes in StopPlotSetup.h also were implemented here

JESUncertHistMaker.C
-Added in this macro to calculate the TH2s associated with the JES uncertainties from an input text file (see associated readme file, JESUncertMakerREADME)

MT2CutYieldCalc.C
-Added in this macro to calculate yield of data, SM backgrounds, and Signal in various MT2 cut regions, with systematics included (see associated readme file, MT2CutYielREADME)

changeLog.txt
-Come on, I'm not going to get that meta on you ;)
